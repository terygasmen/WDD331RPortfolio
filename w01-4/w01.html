                <p>When I was visiting this site, towards the end of the page, there is a heading that's scrolling within its container and I wanted to see how that happens in CSS. </p>
                <p>Eventually, I found this site that taught me how to do exactly just that. It is found <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/scrolling-text-css">here</a>.</p>
                <p>The CSS itself is not hard to write but it's the breaking down of the code that I spent a lot of time in. I had to study on the properties used and why they reacted the way they did.</p>
